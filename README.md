# Training-Scheduling-Platform

This project involves the development of a personal training scheduling system consisting of three services: a User Service for user registration and authentication, a Training Scheduling Service that allows clients to search and book available slots, and gym managers to manage gym data, and a Notification Service that sends email notifications for successful bookings and reminders before training sessions. The User Service manages the registration of different user types with specific privileges, such as clients, gym managers, and administrators. The Training Scheduling Service enables the search and reservation of available slots for individual and group training sessions, as well as updating gym and training data. The Notification Service automatically sends notifications to clients and managers about successful bookings, cancellations, and reminders before training sessions. All interactions between the services are routed through an API gateway, while the client application provides a user interface to access all system functionalities.
